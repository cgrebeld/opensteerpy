opensteerpy
===========

OpenSteer is a popular C++ library implementing steering behaviors for autonomous characters in 
games and animation. OpenSteerPy is a Python wrap of OpenSteer? (using Swig).

Some refactoring of the C++ classes was required to make Swig happy.

OpenSteer was initially developed by Craig Reynolds at the Research and Development group 
of Sony Computer Entertainment America.
